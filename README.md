# tspatch

Simple tool to work on a TS file
- parse and show some information
- make some changes

This tool does not follow any spec, it is just being implemented on demand, started in 2011.

Tool in the shape of one-source-code file, because it's my choice.
 
Compilation on Linux:
gcc -m32 tspatch.ts -o tspatch

Compilation on Windows, with mingw-w64:
gcc.exe tspatch.c -o tspatch
